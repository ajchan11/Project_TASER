##Project - Build TASER (Three Amigos Search Exploration Resourse)

Build a website that allows a user to input a search term and see how the rest of the country interacts with and perceives that term.  Specifically, once a search term is input we will populate a page with images, tweets, and audio/visuals that will create a 360 degree experience for our user.  

###Strategy  

Connect to the following APIs in order to create this rich search experience for our user:  

- Flickr - to access and use pictures
- YouTube - to access and use audio and visual files
- Twitter - to access text-based tweets   

###User Stories

1. A user will find the TASER website
2. A user will create a new account, setting up username (email) and password
3. A user will login with username and password
4. A user will start a new search
5. A user will search on a word or allowable term (need to define search parameters)
6. A user will wait for his TASER page to populate
7. A user will view the populated TASER site from all three API sources
8. A user can comment on the TASER results and have that comment be saved so the next user that searched for that term will be able to view the historical comments left in previous searches
9. A user can clear their TASER search page and start a new TASER search
10. A user can have their life changed by this incredible new way to approach the search experience

###Models   
 There are two models:  
 
1. User model 
2. Comment model 

###Wireframes  

[need to create]

###Initial Division of Labor  

- Noah - build out Twitter API
- Alex - build out Flickr API
- Jeff - build out YouTube API
- Use Mongo & Express to build an API and a front-end that consumes it
- Create an API using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
- Include all major CRUD functions in a RESTful API for at least one of those models
- Consume your own API. Your front end can be made with HTML/CSS and jQuery, or EJS
- Add authentication to your API to restrict access to appropriate users
- Craft thoughtful user stories together, as a team
- Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
- Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS
- Deploy your application online so it's publically accessible
